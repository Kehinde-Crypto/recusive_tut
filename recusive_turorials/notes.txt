the differnce between the recusive principle
 pros and cons of recussion
 pros: bridges the gap between the elegance and complecity
 cons: slowness in the CPU
 pros:the need for complex loops and auxilary data structures
 cons: can lead to memory leak
 pros:can reduce time complexity easlily with memoization
 cons: can be unnnecesary complex if poorly constructed
 DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGORITHMS
 divide problems into servral smaller subproblems
 Normally the subproblems are similar to the original
 Conquer the subproblems by solving them recusively
 Base_Case:sollve small enough problems by the brute force
 Combine the solution to get a solution to the subproblems
 and finally a solution to the origninal problem
 divide and conquer algorthims are normally recusive
